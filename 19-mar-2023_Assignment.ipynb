    "The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling is a method used to normalize features by scaling them to have unit norm, i.e., a length or magnitude of 1. It is also known as vector normalization or vector length normalization. This technique adjusts the values of the features so that they are on the same scale but preserves the direction or orientation of the data.\n",

    "The Unit Vector technique differs from Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, in the way it transforms the data. Min-Max scaling rescales the features linearly to a predefined range, typically between 0 and 1. It subtracts the minimum value from each feature and divides it by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This technique maps the features to a specific range, but it does not guarantee that the resulting vectors will have unit norm.\n",
