    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF for this random variable would assign a probability of 1/6 to each possible outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) and a probability of 0 to any other value that is not possible. So, the PMF for this random variable would be:\n",

    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a range or interval. The PDF describes the likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value. Unlike the PMF, the PDF doesn't give the probability at specific points but rather provides the probability density over intervals. The integral of the PDF over the entire range of the variable is equal to 1.\n",

    "For instance, let's consider a continuous random variable that represents the heights of adult males. The PDF for this variable might follow a normal distribution. The PDF would describe the likelihood of a male having a particular height within a given range. It would provide the probability density per unit of height. However, the probability of a male having a specific height, such as exactly 6 feet, would be 0 since the variable is continuous. To calculate the probability of a male having a height within a specific interval, you would integrate the PDF over that interval.\n",

    "1.    Central Limit Theorem: One key importance of the normal distribution is its relationship with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). According to the CLT, when independent random variables are summed or averaged, their distribution tends to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population. This property makes the normal distribution a valuable tool for approximating the behavior of complex processes or variables that are influenced by multiple factors.\n",

Deviations from normality may require additional considerations or alternative methods.\n",
